1. #! is executed by the kernel system called execve()
2. Shell scripting is interpreted 
3. For bash scripts most common is #!/bin/bash
4. .bash_profile is readed when bash is invoked as a login Shell
5. .bashrc is executed when new shell is started
6. How the admin can make permission??
For ex: Having a variable echo $a 
Now making changes on vi ~/.bashrc file by adding export statement as export echo a=$a:example
Then printing subsequently by changing shell using bash command
